Put Alice to sleep when you don't want to be disturbed

## About 
Tell Alice to sleep when you don't want to be disturbed in any way.
This stops all calls to Speech to Text system, guaranteeing your voice won't
be sent anywhere on an accidental activation.

When sleeping, Alice will only listen locally for the phrase "Alice,
wake up". Otherwise the system will be totally silent and won't bother you.

On a Mark 1 this also dims the eyes.

## Examples 
* "Go to sleep"
* "Nap time"
* "Wake up"
